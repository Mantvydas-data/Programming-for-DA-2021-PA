<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This repository contains continuous assessment for Programming for Data Analysis 2021 module. Files include: gitignore file, readme and Jupyter notebook numpyrandom.ipynb. Assessment instructions can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/brianmcgmit/ProgDA/raw/master/ProgDA_Assignment.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Problem statement</h3>
<p>The following assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python. You are required to create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.</p>
<p>There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook:</p>
<p>1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.</p>
<p>2. Explain the use of the 'Simple random data' and 'Permutations' functions.</p>
<p>3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five 'Distributions' functions.</p>
<p>4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers. </p>

<h3>Libraries and Packages Used</h3>
<p><a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html">Numpy</a> - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html">Matplotlib- Pyplot</a> - Matplotlib.pyplot is a state-based interface to matplotlib, where Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">Seaborn</a> - Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.</p>
<p><a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Jupyter</a> - JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data.</p>

<h3>Running the code</h3>
<p>Assignment has been completed using Python version 3.8.8 that can be downloaded <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a> with Anaconda version 4.10.3 that can be downloaded <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">here</a>. While Python and related libraries-packages can be installed separately it is encouraged to use latest Anaconda distribution that provides a wide variety of data science related tools.</p>
<p>To run the code <a href="https://github.com/Mantvydas-data/Programming-for-DA-2021-PA">repository</a> is to be cloned or files to be downloaded manually as Zip file by following <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo">Github guide</a>. Chosen commander can be used, that will require navigation to repository download location, launching of <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/starting.html">Jupyter</a> environment and opening numpyrandom.ipynb project file.</p>
